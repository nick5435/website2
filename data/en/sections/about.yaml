# a summary about you
summary: 'I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Central Missouri. I did my PhD at the University of Nebraska â€” Lincoln and was advised by Alex Zupan. My current interests are primarily in the geometric and algebraic topology of 3- and 4-manifolds. In particular, I study knot theory in dimensions 3 and 4, Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, and trisections of 4-manifolds. In addition, I am interested in the computational aspects of these areas, particularly computational algebraic topology and computational knot theory. A copy of my CV is available [here](/files/meyer_cv.pdf).'
